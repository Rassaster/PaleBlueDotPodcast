This is one of the projects proposed at the Full Stack Web Development program offered by Acamica.

We received a mockup design for a podcast landing page. The main goals of the project are to acomplish a responsive Front End design development (primarily for MobileS and LaptopL sizes) using only HTML and CSS (the use of any framework is not permitted).
