This is one of the projects proposed at the Full Stack Web Development program offered by Acamica.

We received a mockup for a podcast landing page. The main goal of the project is to acomplish a responsive Front End design development (primarily for MobileS and LaptopL sizes) using only HTML and CSS (the use of any framework is not permitted). 

I decided to use a SASS architecture for the styling.
